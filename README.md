Project Repository for Exploratory Data Analysis Project

This is the Repository for Exploratory Data Analysis Project1 and Project 2

I have following things on this repository as of now:

1. plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png for plots that I have created using the Global Power Consuption Data 
2. plot1.R, plot2.R,plot3.R, plot4.R These codes will work on your system once you set the working directory to the the directory where data is stored on your system. Once this is done, you can run the code and get the output graphs as I have submitted on this repository


The graphs here will be as displayed on the coursea EDA project1 website. In case you have questions or comments do leave me a note
